# ‚≠êOverview

ProStore3 is a simple library used to easily manage  and dynamically update a Roblox's game database. It uses a session lock approach on which it stores and manipulates the users data from the moment they join the session to the moment that they leave.

It was heavily inspired in the popular library [DataStore2](https://kampfkarren.github.io/Roblox/)

**Pros:** 
- Simple
- Low amount of lines
- Very easy to learn and apply
- Enforces a schema similar to SQL databases
