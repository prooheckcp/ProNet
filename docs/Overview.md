# ‚≠êOverview

ProNet is a signal manager that facilitates the connections between the Client and Server in Roblox. It allows you to create connections between the client and the server without having to manually create and manage remote events/remote functions, instead you can connect the client and the server by using case-sensitive named signals.

On top of this ProNet also allows you to add custom options to the connections to help you dealing with exploiters such as request limits on the signals and base64 encryption on both ways.
